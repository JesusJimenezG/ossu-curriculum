# 001 Python for everybody

The first course in the OSSU curriculum as introduction to computer science is [Python for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) by the University of Michigan. Since I already have experience with Python, I decided to skip this course. Instead, in the projects folder there will be a submodule pointing to the repository of an advanced computer vision project I made with Python to demonstrate my skills with the language.
