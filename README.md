# OSSU Curriculum of Computer Science

This is my personal repository for the OSSU curriculum of Computer Science. I am using this repository to keep track of my progress and to showcase my work.

## Introduction

The OSSU curriculum is a complete education in computer science using online materials. It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors. Read more about the curriculum [here](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science?tab=readme-ov-file#summary).

## About me

I'm a self-taught programmer with over 7 years of experience combined between personal, educational and professional projects. Although I did take a couple of semesters of computer science in the university, I never completed my degree due to personal reasons. Being a programmer has been a dream of mine since I was a kid, and as I've grown older, having a solid foundation in computer science has become increasingly important to my career. I'm using this curriculum as to continue my education and to fulfill my dream of becoming a computer scientist.

I'm currently working as a full-stack developer, and I'm looking to specialize in major fields of computer science. I'm also interested in the intersection of computer science and other fields, such as physics and robotics. I love programming as a whole, but I'm keenly interested in challenging fields that require a deep understanding of computer science.
