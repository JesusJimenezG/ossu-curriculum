# OSSU Curriculum of Computer Science

This is my personal repository for the OSSU curriculum of Computer Science. I am using this repository to keep track of my progress and to showcase my work.

## About me

I'm a self-taught programmer with over 7 years of experience combined between personal, educational and professional projects. Although I did take a couple of semesters of computer science in the university, I never completed my degree due to personal reasons. Being a programmer has been a dream of mine since I was a kid, and as I've grown older, having a solid foundation in computer science has become increasingly important to my career. I'm using this curriculum as to continue my education and to fulfill my dream of becoming a computer scientist.

I'm currently working as a full-stack developer, and I'm looking to specialize in major fields of computer science. I'm also interested in the intersection of computer science and other fields, such as physics and robotics. I love programming in whatever language it comes, but I'd love C since it was the very first language I learned, and I have always wanted to include it in my professional work.

As a (personal) side note, I've also grown an interest in becoming proficient in Physics and Mathematics, even though I never had good bases in these fields. I think these are crucial to excel in computer science, and in life in general. I would like to think that someday I'll have a solid foundation in these fields or even a degree in them.
